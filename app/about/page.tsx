                Biscenic is the hush within the hammer, a stillness shaped by rhythm and reason. Technology does not interrupt here; it breathes life. Wood, once silent, begins to dream.
                Each creation is not built—it is born. It listens. It remembers. Through the quiet alchemy of design and code,
                Biscenic gives form a spirit, turning furniture into vessels of memory, soul, and sentient beauty.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Founded by visionary designer Lomon Christopher, Biscenic rose from a devotion to the deeper language of design, a relentless pursuit of artistry, precision, and emotional resonance. More than a design house, it is a living philosophy, an evolving reflection of how we shape our surroundings, and how they, in turn, shape us.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We do not see furniture as static objects. To us, every line is a sentence. Every silhouette is a story. Each piece is sculpted to stir something inward: a feeling, a memory, a truth once forgotten. With hands guided by intuition and minds attuned to innovation, we move beyond style and surface into substance.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                With every creation, Biscenic carries forward a legacy of bold imagination, furniture not simply designed to be seen or used, but to be felt, inhabited, and remembered.
